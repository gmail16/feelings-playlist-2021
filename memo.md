## Introduction 

What up, team. This idea emerged from a post I put up when I woke up fucking pissed off at 4am, and decided that I needed to explore that feeling immediately or I'd never sleep again. 

I've been recently trying to get into meditation (from an app on my phone; to kill time until death or a vaccine, to shut my brain off, to avoid constantly reaching for the most easily available distraction - it's not that deep, it's just like my 8th new quaratine hobby). A thing they say often in the talking parts is to notice when you're having a feeling, to recognize that the feeling exists, notice that there's some distance between you and that feeling, and to let yourself hang out without judging it. And then maybe stop hanging out with that feeling when it no longer serves!

To do that, I decided that I needed to listen to every song I could think of that fit the criteria <b>"will explode my whole heart"</b> and do some reflective writing. It kind of worked! I cried and thought and wrote, and it felt for the first time in at least a year, my brain didn't feel like it was spinning its wheels on ice. Good shit.

I started wondering what music people find themselves returning to in moments of emotional chaos. There are a ton of different, sometimes conflicting factors that, at least for me, make a song really cut deep. Moreover, so many of those factors feel fundamentally personal and individual! Songs win me over through a million little personal affectations (how does it make me feel? how am I experiencing this song? who does it remind me of? when in my life does it remind me of? does it resonate in my body somehow? - even these questions feel wrong. They read like a checklist, when really what I'm looking for is a more intangible, visceral version of: "do you FEEL it though"). Basically, despite that being a highly individual process, it felt like a really powerful thing that maybe people share! That's what we're exploring here! 

## Data and Methods 

Originally, I posted the question:
>"What's one song that puts you RIGHT in your feelings? Sends you all the way up, completely sucks you in, moves your heart? Forces you to feel something? Pushes you to run harder, makes you yell the words, reminds you of an important memory, etc? ANY genre, any mood, but the gist is a song that makes you feel a thing (but send me a song, not just like, the name Frank Ocean. We know)." 

In total, I received around 34 messages with responses out of a sum total of 160 views of that story (wut up lurkers). All respondents were people I knew before the beginning of this project from various parts of life, and represent various distinct geographic regions within the U.S. Respondents offered between one and six songs; I took everything that was recommended to me and compiled it here, with a small set of parameters:

* if someone has accused you of sexual assault, you're not allowed to the playlist. Weezy was also not allowed to the playlist, on account of his bullshit with Trump. 
* no one gets more than 5 first authored tracks
* all songs were located through Spotify (so tracks found elsewhere weren't invited) 
* if it triggered me personally, I cut it. this is a totally subjective rule, and it mostly didn't happen, but there were a few songs I thought about adding and decided that we were just not, as a team, going to go there today. Full disclosure. 

In addition, this playlist includes the original sad garbage I was listening to, so some of this is my own fault (my original sample inlcuded 37 tracks). As of time of publication, the playlist that emerged has a total of 220 songs produced by 215 artists, a sum total of 15 hrs and 40 minutes of content. All recommendations got tossed into a playlist as they came in, but no tracks are specifically attributed to the person who recommended them. 

### Methodological Note
I know this is both extra and super-not science. I am literally just performing academia in a goofball tongue in cheek way because we're a year into a pandemic that has severely impinged my other forms of socializing, and now I do weird shit like this. It's the language I know best! Nothing about this research is rigorous in the sense of meaningful social science, I'm just joshin. But I am doing my best to tell you a story about my experience collecting data and exploring a set of questions. 

### Follow-Up
I considered trying to collect some follow-up "data" on whether you guys are into this or not, but I'm already losing steam on this project as I write this. Nevertheless, I am definitely curious to hear back from people on the following questions:

* What did this original question evoke for you? Does this feel like a thought you recognize or not? What about it held resonance for you?
* What "feelings" emerge from you? Do you feel like you can name them? Are there other ways to describe them? 
* Did this playlist as a whole adequately respond to your own sense of wanting to be "in your feelings" with music? Do you have a sense of why it did or didn't put you in this place? 
* Were there any songs in particular that grabbed you? Any that you found so distracting or bad that you disengaged altogether? Any music you just did not get or did not like? What for you passes the vibe check here, and what squarely misses? 
* How often do you feel like you return to the songs you recommended? To music that makes you feel this way? In what kinds of emotional states does this feel useful for you?
* Anything else you want to add?

Any other qualitative responses you'd like to add will be secured and kept anonymous, and can be sent directly to my email at gmhernandez@wisc.edu. Additionally, if you'd like to use Github for this feature in some regard, please let me know and/or teach me how, as I am deliberately misusing this platform (which I believe is for sharing code across collaborative projects). 

## Findings
Based on an analysis produced through this tool (<a href="https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/">https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/</a>), we find that the most commonly used key signature in this playlist is C#/Db, but C is also popular within this list. The average beats per minute (bpm) on tracks was 117, and the average length of tracks was 4:16. Music drawn from the 2010s decade represents 51 percent of the total sample. 

The Chosic tool also leverages the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/discover/">Spotify Developer Platform</a> to isolate and rank various facets of track mood (danceability, valence, energy, tempo), properties (loudness, speechiness, instrumentalness), context (liveness, acousticness), and segmentation (tatums, parts, beats, bars, pitches, timbre, etc.). These elements are theoretically drawn from various quantifiable elements of songs present in a given track's audio features. Notably, the primary function of these features was designed not to capture specific elements of songs, but to aid in the production of a recommendation algorithm, which will link songs together based on combinations of these features (and likely other kinds of proprietary tags). Chosic determines these characteristics across an entire playlist by using averages of the index scores drawn across specific features (Appendix 1).
