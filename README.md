## Introduction 

What up, team. This idea emerged from a post I put up when I woke up fucking pissed off at 4am, and decided that I needed to explore that feeling immediately or I'd never sleep again. 

I've been recently trying to get into meditation (from an app on my phone; to kill time until death or a vaccine, to shut my brain off, to avoid constantly reaching for the most easily available distraction - it's not that deep, it's just like my 8th new quaratine hobby). A thing they say often in the talking parts is to notice when you're having a feeling, to recognize that the feeling exists, notice that there's some distance between you and that feeling, and to let yourself hang out without judging it. And then maybe stop hanging out with that feeling when it no longer serves!

To do that, I decided that I needed to listen to every song I could think of that fit the criteria <b>"will explode my whole heart"</b> and do some reflective writing. It kind of worked! I cried and thought and wrote, and it felt for the first time in at least a year, my brain didn't feel like it was spinning its wheels on ice. Good shit.
