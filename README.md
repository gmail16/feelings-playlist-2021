tl;dr here it is get excited! It's weird as fuck, but it's art! 

This is now a collaborative playlist, so if you're disappointed that something is missing, add it. If there are issues with permissioning, feel free to let me know!

The order presented here is hopefully alphabetized - otherwise, I tried to drag tracks around into a semi-random state, but I got bored with that strategy. <b>I highly recommend that this playlist be experienced primarily through the shuffle function, and also enjoyed in relatively small doses, but do your thing. </b>
