# feelings-playlist-2021
tl;dr here it is get excited! It's weird as fuck, but  This is now a collaborative playlist, so if you're disappointed that something is missing, add that lil guy! It's 

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1OSt13ueHrDgWZ1xAxNnex?si=i4-_EBPAR7eXVeNNhpRDiQ">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1OSt13ueHrDgWZ1xAxNnex?si=i4-_EBPAR7eXVeNNhpRDiQ</a>

The order presented here is hopefully alphabetized - otherwise, I tried to drag tracks around into a semi-random state, but I got bored with that strategy. <b>I highly recommend that this playlist be experienced primarily through the shuffle function, and also enjoyed in relatively small doses, but do your thing. </b>

## Introduction 

What up, team. This idea emerged from a post I put up when I woke up fucking pissed off at 4am, and decided that I needed to explore that feeling immediately or I'd never sleep again. 

I've been recently trying to get into meditation (from an app on my phone; to kill time until death or a vaccine, to shut my brain off, to avoid constantly reaching for the most easily available distraction - it's not that deep, it's just like my 8th new quaratine hobby). A thing they say often in the talking parts is to notice when you're having a feeling, to recognize that the feeling exists, notice that there's some distance between you and that feeling, and to let yourself hang out without judging it. And then maybe stop hanging out with that feeling when it no longer serves!

To do that, I decided that I needed to listen to every song I could think of that fit the criteria <b>"will explode my whole heart"</b> and do some reflective writing. It kind of worked! I cried and thought and wrote, and it felt for the first time in at least a year, my brain didn't feel like it was spinning its wheels on ice. Good shit.

I started wondering what music people find themselves returning to in moments of emotional chaos. There are a ton of different, sometimes conflicting factors that, at least for me, make a song really cut deep. Moreover, so many of those factors feel fundamentally personal and individual! Songs win me over through a million little personal affectations (how does it make me feel? how am I experiencing this song? who does it remind me of? when in my life does it remind me of? does it resonate in my body somehow? - even these questions feel wrong. They read like a checklist, when really what I'm looking for is a more intangible, visceral version of: "do you FEEL it though"). Basically, despite that being a highly individual process, it felt like a really powerful thing that maybe people share! That's what we're exploring here! 

## Data Sample 

Originally, I posted the question:
>"What's one song that puts you RIGHT in your feelings? Sends you all the way up, completely sucks you in, moves your heart? Forces you to feel something? Pushes you to run harder, makes you yell the words, reminds you of an important memory, etc? ANY genre, any mood, but the gist is a song that makes you feel a thing (but send me a song, not just like, the name Frank Ocean. We know)." 

In total, I received around 34 messages with responses out of a sum total of 160 views of that story (wut up lurkers). All respondents were people I knew before the beginning of this project from various parts of life, and represent various distinct geographic regions within the U.S. Respondents offered between one and six songs; I took everything that was recommended to me and compiled it here, with a small set of parameters:

* if someone has accused you of sexual assault, you're not allowed to the playlist. Weezy was also not allowed to the playlist, on account of his bullshit with Trump. 
* no one gets more than 5 first authored tracks
* all songs were located through Spotify (so tracks found elsewhere weren't invited) 
* if it triggered me personally, I cut it. this is a totally subjective rule, and it mostly didn't happen, but there were a few songs I thought about adding and decided that we were just not, as a team, going to go there today. Full disclosure.
